# React Molecule - Documentation

- [Basic Concepts](./CONCEPTS.md) - Understand the basic taxonomy and logic
- [Molecule Tree](./MOLECULE_TREE.md) - Yes. It can be done.
- [API](./API.md) - Now you know Molecule. Use the API as your reference.

## Feel free to contribute

Our aim is to make the documentation as simple and intuitive as possible, if you feel like you have trouble with some concepts or that they are hard to digest, it's very likely that they were not properly documented, so feel free to create a Pull-Request to improve it, or create an issue and we'll take care of it!
