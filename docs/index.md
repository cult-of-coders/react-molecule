# React Molecule - Documentation

The learning curve is split into the following chapters:

- [Basic Concepts](./CONCEPTS.md) - Understand the basic taxonomy and logic
- [Learn By Example](./EXAMPLES.md) - Learn by seeing real-world examples
- [Advanced Examples](./ADVANCED.md) - Crossing the territory from noob to pro
- [Write Redux from Scratch](./REDUX.md) - Learn how to write Redux from scratch with molecule

Our aim is to make the documentation as simple and intuitive as possible, if you feel like you have trouble with some concepts or that they are hard to digest, it's very likely that they were not properly documented, so feel free to create a Pull-Request to improve it, or create an issue and we'll take care of it!
